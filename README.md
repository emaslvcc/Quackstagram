# Quackstagram (BCS1430 30%)

## Installation

1. Client must have an IDE of their choice (eg VSCode)
2. Client must clone the repository to their local machine
3. Client must open the Quackstagram folder in their local machine
4. Configure the IDE to use JDK 20
5. Run the code from IDE

## Usage

Once the client has run the code they will be presented with a sign in page. From there the client can create a new account, upload their bio, and upload a profile picture. Once the client has created a new account, they can log into their account and access the Quackstagram app. The client is presented with 5 pages.

## Features

The 5 pages include a Profile page, a notifications page, an Image Upload page, an Explore page, and a Quackstagram page.
The Profile page shows the clients personal page. The image upload page is where a client can upload an image. The explore page allows clients to follow other users. The quackstagram page allows users to view the images of users they follow. For our special Business clients they can create a business account which will display that they are a business acount when other users view their account.

## Technologies Used

We used java for the creation of this project and it was coded on VSCode.
